## Thoughts

- seems like a fairly simple parse and match problem
- Option to the rescue!

## Reflection

- Went pretty much as planned
- Kind of long winded to code, would be interesting to review other solutions
- Careful with regex's being greedy. Use ? to stop at first match, or be more
  specific in captures. E.g., specify character classes rather than a generic
  .\* match.
