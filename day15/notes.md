# Advent of Code 2015 Day 15

## Thoughts

- Linear programming optimisation problem?
- Probably a short cut here
- Brute force solution is approximately 100_000_000 iterations?
- Going to try to brute force it first
- Actually, this requires all partitions of an integer n (= 100) into m (=
  number of ingredients) parts.
- There's potential for some partitions to be ignored/skipped if they would
  result in a score of 0
